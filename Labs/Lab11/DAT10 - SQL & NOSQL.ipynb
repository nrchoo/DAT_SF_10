      "**[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/)** is a database software package built on the Structured Query Language [(SQL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL).  It is similar to other SQL databases, such as [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, except that it is *file-based*, rather than *server-based*.  This makes it easy to setup and use for small projects, but less suitable for production environments.  Once you are familiar with sqlite, the same ideas, and similar syntax, can be applied to other SQL databases."

      "\n",
      "If you do any significant SQL programming in python, you may find it convenient to use a library or framework that provides a higher-level abstraction of your database.  Such libraries often include an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), which allows you to work with data in terms of python objects or classes, transparently handling database operations in the background.  A few examples are included here for reference:\n",
